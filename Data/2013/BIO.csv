This wealth of data creates the opportunity to address a pressing need, namely to explore the patterns and drivers of infectious disease emergence in humans and natural ecosystems at global scales. This project will create a Research Coordination Network to bring together internationally recognized experts from ecology, conservation medicine, parasitology and computational sciences to quantify and explore the drivers of global scale patterns of pathogen biodiversity. Participants will work together to assemble data sets of unprecedented size, including information about disease occurrence in host species ranging from insects to humans. With help from experts in machine learning (artificial intelligence) and geographic information systems (GIS), they will work to build predictive models that can be used to understand the changing distributions of infectious diseases and identify future hotspots of novel disease emergence in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>Emerging infectious diseases, especially those that jump from wildlife to livestock and humans, threaten public health around the world. Using state of the art computational methods, the RCN will be able to answer critical questions such as: How and why do certain pathogens successfully move from one host species to another? Are hotspots of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife the same areas as hotspots of disease emergence in humans and livestock? To share its findings, the RCN will develop educational products such as webcasts and workshops aimed at educational levels from high school to post graduate, and will train students from under-represented groups through a summer research program. The RCN will also develop and maintain databases of global infectious disease biodiversity and make these data freely available to the academic community and the general public.",Data infrastructure,"ML, GIS"

Similar types of vascular networks are essential for the flow of resources in nearly all multicellular organisms, including plants (xylem networks), insects (tracheal networks), and mammals. Understanding which evolutionary principles and environmental factors drive the structure of vascular networks, and what constrains the flow through them, could help lead to a better understanding of organismic structure and function with implications for systems as diverse as forests, food webs, and even tumors. This research project will supply the data needed to directly test existing models and to develop new, more realistic models. Outputs will be new software for extracting vascular data from images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT)), a large database for vascular measurements in plants and animals, identification of branching patterns common to specific taxa or tissues, and new theory. Measurements will include vessel radii, lengths, branching ratios, and branching angles. Existing models are contradicted by some preliminary results, including asymmetric branching (two daughter vessels of different sizes and different flow) and deviations from self-similarity (similar branching patterns recurring across scales). New models will be constructed to incorporate these findings and used to predict connections between the geometry of and flow through vascular networks. A key prediction of models will be scaling exponents that describe how the number of capillaries changes with network volume. In an attempt to enable quick translation of branching geometry into predictions for flow rate, techniques will be adapted to classify vascular networks according to a suite of these characteristic scaling exponents.<br/><br/>Closely integrated with these research objectives are three educational goals: 1) teach students how to use image recognition software to extract data from images across biological fields, including museum collections and labs, 2) teach students how to translate empirical results into equations and test specific, mechanistic hypotheses, and 3) motivate data sharing with the public and scientific community via websites for large, comprehensive databases that will accelerate scientific research and community outreach. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers will all be trained during this research. Notably, summer research experiences for three high school students will be provided for each year of the project. A critical aspect of this training is in teaching students how to combine theory and empirical data and how to disseminate research findings through publications, websites, curricular materials, and talks at professional meetings as well as outreach. The PI has experience educating and training students at all levels and will actively recruit students from under-represented groups to engage in informatics research.

This project will transform RaptorX, a popular protein structure modeling web server, to one that can also annotate functions of a protein sequence and the quality of a theoretical protein model in the absence of the corresponding native structure. The resultant new server will greatly facilitate the interpretation and proper usage of a theoretical protein model, just like what E-value does for homology search. The server will also predict functions of a protein sequence with coverage beyond what can be reached by native-structure-based methods and accuracy much higher than sequence-based methods. Ultimately, the project will deliver a long-term sustainable cyber-infrastructure for protein sequence, structure and functional analysis that enables transformative biological and biomedical research. This project will also advance protein structure and functional prediction by developing several sophisticated computational methods for model quality assessment and functional prediction. <br/><br/>Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes.

This work seeks to bridge mathematical and biological methods that have hitherto been developed largely in isolation, such as optimal control (from decision-theoretic work) and early warning signals (from resilience work) as well as machine learning approaches (from statistics and computer science). To anchor this work in the biology of a real world problem, examples and applications will come from the ecosystem dynamics and economic concerns of marine fisheries. The three main objectives of this project are: (1) Develop an approach to integrate early warning signals into a decision-theory framework (2) explore how nonparametric Bayesian inference can account for structural uncertainty in ecological dynamics, (3) explore how active learning approaches in each of these areas could be developed to design adaptive management policies that actively decrease uncertainty.<br/><br/>Effective decision-making in face of deep uncertainty is a fundamental challenge across many disciplines. Methods that can improve the ability to select robust actions under such circumstances may have far reaching value. Such real-world applications will only emerge as they are percolated through and developed by a larger community of researchers and managers.

Pollen and spores play a particularly important role in paleontology, because they form the most abundant and extensive record of plant diversity, dating back hundreds of millions of years. However, the most critical hypotheses in plant ecology and evolution (e.g. the assembly of plant communities, speciation and extinction) cannot be fully tested with pollen data due to the extreme difficulty of recognizing species from pollen and spore material. This project develops new methods to probe the shape and fine structural and textural properties of the grains using high-throughput, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy and automated image analysis in order to transform species identification from a subjective, by-eye procedure to a quantitative, computational practice. Since it is not known a priori which morphological features are phylogenetically meaningful, new machine learning techniques are being developed to model pollen images at multiple scales, identify aspects of shape and texture that are statistically informative, and infer their relation to the underlying phylogenetic structure. <br/><br/>The project has the ambitious long-term goal of creating a high-throughput system for analyzing pollen data that incorporates meaningful characterizations of pollen and spore morphology, provides testable hypotheses of biological affinity, and is open and available to the entire scientific community.

Due to alternative splicing events in eukaryotic cells, the identification of mRNA isoforms (or transcripts) is a difficult problem in molecular biology. Traditional experimental methods for this purpose are time-consuming and cost  ineffective. The emerging RNA-Seq technology provides a possible effective way to address this problem. This project aims to develop efficient and accurate methods for inferring isoforms and estimating their abundance levels from RNA-Seq data where the reads may be sampled non-uniformly due to the existence of various biases including positional, sequencing and mappability biases. In particular, a novel statistical framework based on quasi-multinomial distributions will be introduced and a companion expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm developed for estimating isoform abundance levels that can handle all above biases in RNA-Seq data. The algorithms will be implemented efficiently in C++, tested extensively on both simulated and real RNA-Seq data in human, mouse and drosophila, and made available to the public for free. The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated extensively using both simulated and real RNA-Seq data. In the latter case, perturbations to some important splicing factors will be introduced into selected cell lines to induce widespread alteration of splicing events. RNA-Seq data of these cells, combined with quantitative RT-PCR validation, will provide an enriched dataset to assess the performance of the algorithms in  predicting both isoform abundance and relative variation. In addition, the  validation results may provide insight on the regulatory functions of the splicing  factors and serve as a testbed for further improvement of the algorithms.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is twofold. First, RNA-Seq data analysis is a timely topic in bioinformatics due to the recent rapid advance in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and its potential impact in life sciences and medicine. Despite the success of many RNA-Seq applications, several challenges remain in the analysis of RNA-Seq data, one of which comes from the understanding and handling of biases in RNA-Seq reads. The approaches proposed in this project for treating RNA-Seq biases combine unique techniques from statistics, machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Moreover, the experimental validation results may shed light on the regulatory functions of some important splicing factors. Second, the project will provide an excellent opportunity for the training of two computer science PhD students, a postdoc and two biology undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of computational biology and bioinformatics. Since many of the involved students are female, the research will also help improve the representation of women in science and engineering.",Molecular Biology; Bioinformatics,"EM algorithm, "

Although numerous methods have been developed to infer a network from expression data, several computational challenges remain unsolved, such as, how to derive non-linear relationships between transcription factors and targets, how to properly decompose a network into individual sub-network modules, how to predict biologically significant genes via network-scale comparisons, how to integrate and use the heterogeneous forms of biological interaction data to facilitate network analysis, and how to seamlessly visualize a large-scale network for interactive data mining. To solve these problems, the primary goal of this project is to develop a software package - the Gini Network Analysis Toolkit (GNAT) that utilizes the Gini-based methodologies: a family of mathematical solutions that have been widely used in economics, physics, informatic networks, and social networks in analyzing non-normally distributed data. The core functional modules and algorithms in the GNAT include the use of supervised machine learning methods to infer transcriptional networks, the Gini correlation coefficient to derive non-linear regulatory relationships, the Gini regression analysis to decompose a time-series network, the Gini index to measure and compare the distributions of the network properties of modules and genes under different biological conditions, and eventually the discovery of biologically important genes with system perturbation and decision tree analysis. The PI will also develop a network explorer, BioNetscape, to efficiently organize and visualize the tremendous amount of network data generated from the GNAT using the k-core decomposition algorithm, Ajax technology and GPU (graphical processing unit) computing techniques. The GNAT will be implemented in R and organized as a streamlined workflow to compensate the shortcomings of the traditional gene-scale transcriptome analysis methods.<br/><br/>The GNAT software will greatly facilitate the ongoing network development projects in plant research.

Pollen and spores play a particularly important role in paleontology, because they form the most abundant and extensive record of plant diversity, dating back hundreds of millions of years. However, the most critical hypotheses in plant ecology and evolution (e.g. the assembly of plant communities, speciation and extinction) cannot be fully tested with pollen data due to the extreme difficulty of recognizing species from pollen and spore material. This project develops new methods to probe the shape and fine structural and textural properties of the grains using high-throughput, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy and automated image analysis in order to transform species identification from a subjective, by-eye procedure to a quantitative, computational practice. Since it is not known a priori which morphological features are phylogenetically meaningful, new machine learning techniques are being developed to model pollen images at multiple scales, identify aspects of shape and texture that are statistically informative, and infer their relation to the underlying phylogenetic structure. <br/><br/>The project has the ambitious long-term goal of creating a high-throughput system for analyzing pollen data that incorporates meaningful characterizations of pollen and spore morphology, provides testable hypotheses of biological affinity, and is open and available to the entire scientific community. This will allow researchers to break through the current taxonomic limitations of pollen identification and fundamentally change current practices in the discipline on many levels, from the basic task of identification and counting to the interpretation and use of these data in global climate-vegetation models. The project brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary team including international collaborators at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and will train graduate and undergraduate students from multiple scientific disciplines and backgrounds in an emerging area of interdisciplinary research. A public outreach component is in development that will include a virtual microscopy web site using images generated by this research to introduce non-experts to the beauty, complexity, and relevance of pollen morphology.

Due to alternative splicing events in eukaryotic cells, the identification of mRNA isoforms (or transcripts) is a difficult problem in molecular biology. Traditional experimental methods for this purpose are time-consuming and cost  ineffective. The emerging RNA-Seq technology provides a possible effective way to address this problem. This project aims to develop efficient and accurate methods for inferring isoforms and estimating their abundance levels from RNA-Seq data where the reads may be sampled non-uniformly due to the existence of various biases including positional, sequencing and mappability biases. In particular, a novel statistical framework based on quasi-multinomial distributions will be introduced and a companion expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm developed for estimating isoform abundance levels that can handle all above biases in RNA-Seq data. The algorithms will be implemented efficiently in C++, tested extensively on both simulated and real RNA-Seq data in human, mouse and drosophila, and made available to the public for free. The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated extensively using both simulated and real RNA-Seq data. In the latter case, perturbations to some important splicing factors will be introduced into selected cell lines to induce widespread alteration of splicing events. RNA-Seq data of these cells, combined with quantitative RT-PCR validation, will provide an enriched dataset to assess the performance of the algorithms in  predicting both isoform abundance and relative variation. In addition, the  validation results may provide insight on the regulatory functions of the splicing  factors and serve as a testbed for further improvement of the algorithms.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is twofold. First, RNA-Seq data analysis is a timely topic in bioinformatics due to the recent rapid advance in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and its potential impact in life sciences and medicine. Despite the success of many RNA-Seq applications, several challenges remain in the analysis of RNA-Seq data, one of which comes from the understanding and handling of biases in RNA-Seq reads. The approaches proposed in this project for treating RNA-Seq biases combine unique techniques from statistics, machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Moreover, the experimental validation results may shed light on the regulatory functions of some important splicing factors. Second, the project will provide an excellent opportunity for the training of two computer science PhD students, a postdoc and two biology undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of computational biology and bioinformatics. Since many of the involved students are female, the research will also help improve the representation of women in science and engineering.",Molecular biology; Bioinformatics,"EM algorithm, ML"
