However, scientists have been unable to efficiently use this record because pollen is still studied much in the same low technology way it was a century ago: by a highly trained expert using a transmitted light microscope. The proposed research intends to transform the study of pollen and spores into a high throughput and precise science by developing an automated system capable of identifying and classifying extremely diverse pollen and spore samples. This system will establish standards approaches for automated classification and be based on recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. The system will be developed and tested on 900 samples of pollen material collected over seventeen years from pollen traps placed in two tropical forests in Panama. Automation will allow, for the first time, a detailed study of the seasonal production of pollen in response to multiple El Nino-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, events.<br/><br/>The results of the proposed research will increase the quantity and quality of tropical pollen data and promote needed research on the large scale dynamics of plant communities that is recorded in fossil pollen records. This research represents a fundamental transformation in the way scientists think about and approach the analysis of pollen data. The machine learning software that will be developed will be publically available, with the hope that other researchers will then adopt the methods and standards and establish objective measures for consistent and reliable pollen identifications.

Snails, with their very large nerve cells and simple neural circuitry, have enabled major advances in our<br/>understanding of molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Many key cellular and molecular discoveries in mollusks have proved generalizable to the brains of mammals, because these mechanisms have been conserved throughout evolution.<br/><br/>This meeting will bring together neurobiologists who work on two important molluscan groups, the simpler gastropods (e.g. snails) and the more complex cephalopods (e.g.squid and octopus) to freely discuss their latest findings. Octopus and squid represent advanced forms of intelligence that evolved entirely independently from vertebrates.  These distinct forms of intelligence have the potential for providing influential models for developing artificial intelligence and computer-controlled precise motion of artificial appendages.<br/><br/>The meeting will generate novel collaborations among attendees, particularly because this is a unique venue for discussions between leaders in gastropod and cephalopod neuroscience. Cellular, molecular and genomic advances in gastropods have the potential for greatly benefiting research in more complex cephalopods.

This research presents a microsystem that generates specific concentration profiles of multiply relevant chemical species to study the development and differentiation of neurons.  Using micro and nanofabrication, a microsystem will be designed, fabricated, characterized, and used to generate chemical profiles of known chemicals that affect spinal cord development.

The problem of serial order in behavior permeates human language, the ability to play a musical instrument, or any number of other activities where human or animal intent can only be effectively communicated if several behavioral gestures are chained together in a specific sequence.  How the brain accomplishes this task is currently unknown.  One approach is to use an animal model (a songbird, the zebra finch) in which the brain region responsible for the serial ordering of song syllables has been identified (called ""HVC"", the acronym is the proper name).  This project will investigate the hypothesis that the serial ordering of song syllables is mapped across several spatially-arranged chains of HVC neurons.  This hypothesis is based on preliminary data indicating that HVC neural activity is largely confined to a single spatial axis during singing.  Experiments will delineate the spatial organization of connections and electrophysiological properties of HVC neurons.  Computational models based on the properties of HVC neurons will then be used to discover network configurations that produce orderly, sequential patterns of neural activity.  Models will be validated with circuit-breaking experiments in behaving birds.  Results will provide a first look at a network architecture used by an animal brain to create order and sequence in behavior, which in turn will provide a computational platform to understand how the process of learning new behavioral sequences utilizes or shapes such architectures.  The research plan coordinates the activity of a faculty research team from three different academic departments (Psychology, Mathematics and Statistics), providing graduate and undergraduate students with access to the expertise of faculty researchers outside their home departments.

Three dimensional (3D) scanning technologies are enabling fundamental advances in scientific understanding of ecosystem structure and function in woodlands (forests and shrublands) while providing new tools for rapid assessment of biodiversity and carbon storage across landscapes.  Existing 3D scanning technologies are based on precision laser scanning systems, which remain prohibitively expensive and technically challenging to deploy, limiting their application to a relatively small number of field sites, investigators and time periods.  This project aims to transform the practice of field ecology in woodlands by enabling the routine and frequent acquisition, use, and sharing of 3D scanning data by both ecologists and citizen scientists.  This will enable remote sensing and advanced 3D analytics to become a ""user-driven"" rather than ""expert-driven"" technology.  Ecosynth 3D scanning technology applies Structure from Motion algorithms to images acquired in the field using ordinary consumer-grade digital cameras, including camera-equipped cell phones, deployed in computer-optimized patterns on the ground or from the air by hobbyist remote controlled aircraft.  The Ecosynth toolkit developed by this project will be offered as an open-source development resource on the community website (http://ecotope.org/projects/ecosynth/), and to potential users as a set of tools enabling the following capabilities: 1) computer assisted optimal image acquisition for 3D scanning (ground and aerial), 2) rapid generation of high-spatial resolution georeferenced 3D scans (multispectral point clouds), 3) an online browser-based system for sharing and visualizing 3D scans of terrestrial ecosystems that will enable expert and other users to identify, tag and make other spatially explicit markups of ecological objects in a 3D virtual environment.  Development and extension of these capabilities will bring the cutting edge of ecological observations and informatics into the hands of those with the most field experience, potentially enabling the ""crowd-sourcing"" of landscape ecology.<br/><br/>Woodlands are currently targeted for carbon and biodiversity conservation by REDD+ and other international agreements and are therefore key areas for expanded scientific research and monitoring- Ecosynth tools will aid in these efforts.  Enabling regular inexpensive use of 3D imaging tools by field ecologists and citizen scientists will expand forest observation capabilities to a much wider pool of observers, thereby assisting in global forest conservation efforts and even urban forestry.  The project is built upon engaging students in interdisciplinary teams across multiple stages in their careers, from high school students (field testing), undergraduates (Ecology, Geography, Math, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Information Systems), graduate students (Geography & Environmental Systems, Computer Science & Engineering), and postdoctoral researchers.  Work will also engage the public, guided by an advisory panel including both disciplinary experts (ecology, computer science) and conservation organizations with citizen science programs.  Ultimately the Ecosynth project aims to spark the development of an open source 3D ecology community dedicated to developing, sharing and investigating the ecology of woodlands based on the results of 3D scanning using computer vision.",Ecology,CV

This work couples crowd-sourcing with computational learning. In an identification system that learns from user inputs, multiple inputs can accelerate the quality and rate of identification, which in turn dramatically reduces subsequent work-cycles any human performs. The hypothesis is that Computational learning will improve the quality of human-machine coupled system's solutions to help solve large and diverse identification problems. Several interactive learning algorithms are proposed in all stages of indexing and search in Biological Image Databases. The algorithms are based on non-parametric Bayesian inference and deliver incremental online learning methods. To test the interactive learning hypothesis, the MIT Sloop system will be extended to include the proposed interactive learning tools. Sloop is a robust toolkit for vision tools that has been tested on multiple species and supports an operational deployment. As part of this research a distributed Sloop system indexing multiple species will be developed.<br/> <br/>It is difficult to accurately estimate the effectiveness of conservation efforts for many rare and endangered species without an ability to quantify the spatial scales and other statistics of animal migration and movement. Tagging, an established method, is of limited effectiveness because it is often invasive and cannot be conducted in large numbers. This research looks at whether a large number of animals in multiple species can be identified individually using photographs stored in a database. The ""Animal biometrics"" proposed here will examine how citizen scientists can crowd-source relevance judgments and other inputs, how judgments can improve the computer's identification performance, and how improved performance reduces the citizen or expert scientist's workload. The mechanics of the symbiotic human-computer interaction mediated by machine learning, and the methods by which patterns are indexed and searched also have impacts in other fields. For example, some of the tools developed here have been applied in Geosciences and Weather Prediction.",Ecology- data infrastructure ,ML

This is especially true for males of species in which both males and females help to raise young because males have to both defend territories and care for young. One mechanism that might explain this quick change is the rapid release of testosterone (T).  When T is released, animals show a preference for the place in which they were located at the time of T release. We will test whether, in nature, the context (defending a territory at a home range boundary or being a caring parent at a nest) of the T release has an influence on behavior.  We predict that when T release occurs near the territory boundary, the animal will interact with intruders, likely in conjunction with ultrasound vocalizations.  On the other hand, we predict that when T release occurs near the nest, the animal will focus its attention on its mate and offspring.  We will test our predictions by injecting T into monogamous California mouse males at their territory boundary and at their nest and look for behavioral responses using remote sensing methods that include automated radio-telemetry, acoustic recording, and thermal-imaging.  Our results are expected to provide evidence that T is an important hormone for regulating relatively rapid tradeoffs among behaviors involving competition and those involving the mate and offspring.  This project is an important collaboration between an R1 and small research campus in which all participants will be uniquely trained in innovative approaches that address cutting edge yet fundamental issues in animal behavior.

The depth of transcript data accumulating for many plant species under numerous experimental conditions provide unprecedented evidence for the evaluation of all aspects of transcription, including precise mapping of transcription start sites as well as dominant and alternative splice sites. This project engages a team of experts in a wide range of fields, including genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning, high performance computing, and software engineering to jointly work toward a solution for accurately predicting the expressed protein-coding gene transcriptome from plant genome sequences. Successful completion of the project will result in the deployment of (1) software that implements the novel prediction algorithms, (2) visualization and data access portals, and (3) a cyberinfrastructure environment implementation of the developed tools for distributed computing, sharing of protocols, and analysis provenance recording. In the long run, the project seeks to explore the extent to which genomic biology can transition from a largely descriptive to a highly predictive science driven by quantitative measurements, with algorithms and computation as the domain-adapted language. <br/><br/>The project will generate standardized, accurate protein-coding gene structure annotation for 25 plant genomes from a wide range of the phylogenetic spectrum. Initial emphasis will be on improved annotation of recently sequenced genomes, which will benefit the entire community of researchers working on these important crops. The anticipated algorithms for transcriptome prediction will be essential to the analysis of the thousands of complete plant genome sequences likely to become available within the next few years. Through the development of reliable gold standard annotations and the dissemination of training and test sets for algorithmic development, a larger community of computational data analysts, in particular from the machine learning community, will be engaged.

The aim is thus not only to quantitatively describe shape, but to develop methods for linking morphological variation to its underlying biological causes.

However, shape is still often examined on a qualitative basis in many disciplines in biology, an approach that is time consuming and prone to human subjectivity. While ad hoc quantitative methods do exist, they are often inaccessible to non-experts and do not easily generalize to a wide variety of problems. The inability of biologists to systematically link shape to genetics, development, environment, function and evolution often precludes advances in biological research spanning diverse spatial and temporal scales, from the movement of molecules within a cell to adaptive changes in organismal morphology.

Different surfaces elicit different vibrations, and it is on the basis of these differences that we are able to discriminate silk from, say, satin. The ability to extract meaningful information from skin vibrations implies neural mechanisms that have yet to be discovered. This project investigates the mechanisms by which information about surface texture is extracted from texture-elicited vibrations. To this end, the Principal Investigator records (using a laser Doppler vibrometer) the skin vibrations elicited by everyday textured surfaces and examines the information conveyed. He then records the responses evoked by various textured surfaces in the nerve of Rhesus macaques and has human participants perform discrimination experiments using these same textures. Exploiting the well-documented homology between human and Rhesus sensory systems, he uses a variety of computational and machine learning techniques to reveal which aspects of the neural response account for our ability to distinguish between textures. Ultimately, the processing of skin oscillations constitutes a distinct and poorly understood mode of somatosensory processing. Indeed, while analogies have been drawn between visual and tactile processing of shape and motion, this second processing mode draws strong analogies with the auditory system. In both systems, stimulus information is extracted from spectrally complex oscillations (of the ear drum or the skin for audition and touch, respectively). In addition to their important scientific implications, results from this project will inform the development of sensorized upper-limb neuroprostheses and of virtual haptics displays.

The research focuses on the interactions of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK), the main nutrient chemicals used in commercial fertilizers. Optimizing plant growth in response to NPK nutrient interactions has the potential to increase biomass production, while decreasing the toxic leaching of these chemicals (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) into surface and ground waters, thus impacting the environment and human health. In now classic experiments, Murashige and Skoog (1962) showed that the interactions of NPK could lead to an increase in biomass under low N-input conditions. This project seeks to identify the gene networks underlying the ""NPK interaction effect"" on biomass by combining genomic, phenotyping, and network inference approaches. Our experimental and analytical strategy is the result of a highly successful collaboration between biologists and computer scientists, and involves an iterative cycle of experimentation and computation, a hallmark of systems biology. The aims of the project are to: 1. Identify combinations of NPK treatments that result in high biomass under low N-input; 2. Define ""early"" molecular marker genes that act as predictors of biomass; 3. Conduct genome-wide RNA analysis and modeling to identify gene regulatory networks associated with low-N High-biomass state; and 4. Test candidate regulatory genes. The ultimate goal is to uncover genes and pathways that control plant growth under NPK treatments and to manipulate them to optimize N-use efficiency and biomass production.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The long-term advantage of this project is to identify and target critical regulatory components controlling nutrient use efficiency to create crops that produce high biomass with a reduced amount of fertilizer, hence decreasing the health and ecological impacts of leached chemicals.

In the USA, while overall anuran population declines are clearly evident, species that will be hardest hit are hard to predict. The spatial and temporal monitoring of anuran populations needs to be improved if the signs of further population failures are to be identified and remedies sought. The ideal means to increase the coverage of data is to put out sensors that would detect frogs, or have highly trained researchers conduct surveys. However, both these options are cost-prohibitive. A more cost-effective means to gather these data is to take advantage of the many volunteers interested in the fate of anurans. The limitation to date has been the time-consuming and inherently variable success in training those volunteers to recognize anuran vocalizations. In the proposed research, machine-learning algorithms and statistical analysis of sonograms will be used to provide reproducible, standardized identification of calling anurans in real time.<br/> A novel use of mobile devices (e.g. iPods, phones, and tablets) is proposed to identify and map anurans. The vocal recognition software will be developed as application (app) for mobile devices. By producing an efficient and intuitive app, that integrates with an accompanying social network an army of potential volunteers can be involved in mapping the abundance and range of anurans. While this proposal takes advantage of cutting-edge technology in terms of voice recognition, connectivity and social media, its purpose is not to advance any one of those branches of technology. Rather it applies existing technology in a novel way to increase participation in this aspect of citizen science by more than an order of magnitude, and bring the cost of automated voice recognition down by almost three orders of magnitude (from close to $1000 to ~$1). In providing a standardized means to recognize anuran calls, data quality and the reliability of data gathered by volunteers will be improved.<br/>    <br/>General statement of project importance<br/> Frogs and toads are excellent indicators of habitat quality, not just of their spawning sites, but also of adjacent uplands. These creatures are experiencing an unprecedented collapse in populations due to habitat loss, pollution, and novel diseases. As the faltering of amphibian populations may presage wider ecological problems, it is important to document where species are most affected. In the proposed research, an application (app) will be developed for smart phones and other mobile devices that will use cutting edge voice-recognition software to identify frogs and toads. Currently the average age for volunteers conducting anuran surveys is  about 50. By using modern social media and portable device technology the goal of this proposal is to engage a younger audience. The affordability of the system will make it appropriate for classroom use, and it has the potential to spur studies in ecology, physics, geography, and math, as the students consider the data, sonograms, and maps that the software will produce. Through active dissemination we believe this app could quickly be adopted by thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of users, many of whom would be new contributors to citizen science.","Data infrastructure/collection, Ecology",
