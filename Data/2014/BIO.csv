The result will be a set of reagents that will be made freely available to the scientific community through nonprofit repositories and service centers.  This new set of tools will enable the study of neural circuitry with greater resolution, power, and throughput than is currently possible, allowing major advances to be made in understanding the organization of the complex neural systems underlying perception, cognition, and behavior.  This increased understanding could also result in improved artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Finally, the future direct application of the technology in human patients holds promise for potentially treating conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, by allowing the selective activation or inactivation of distinct components of the compromised neural circuitry that is associated with these disorders.<br/><br/>Over the last decade, sophisticated genetic tools have been developed that allow control and monitoring of neuron electrical activity using light alone.  ""Optogenetics"", as this area of technology has become known, is only useful if optogenetic molecules can be specifically expressed in functionally meaningful groups of neurons instead of broadly in all the diverse neuron types that are present in any brain region.  This requirement has confined their use almost entirely to genetically modified (transgenic) mice and rats.  The approach of using transgenic animals has three major disadvantages.  First, the production and maintenance of transgenic rodents is very expensive.  Second, even within transgenic rodents, it allows the optogenetic study and manipulation of only one or two cell types at a time, preventing powerful combinatorial experiments in which different neuron types are independently controlled within the same tissue.  These combinatorial experiments will be critical for deciphering the complex interactions between cell types. Third, it restricts the experiments to rodents, preventing studies in other important taxa including primates, in which optogenetic experimentation during complex cognitive tasks would almost certainly provide major insights into the neural circuitry underlying cognition. This project aims to create engineered binding proteins that recognize selected endogenous proteins that will then act as scaffolds for assembly of transcription factors that will activate gene expression in specific neurons.",Neuroscience; Optogenetics,Impact on AI and ML

Technology that offers the path for high resolution deep brain functional imaging is urgently needed in order to further advance the fundamental understanding of how the brain works. This project will investigate a fiber-optic imaging instrument incorporating adaptable optics. The miniature fiber-optic imaging system implanted minimally-invasively will enable visualization of thousands of neurons deep in the brain.

Such decision making, however, is not always easy to study or understand because a number of factors can bias behavioral choice in dynamic ways (for example, fluctuating neurohormones or environmental conditions). Even in simpler invertebrate animals, with a reduced number of brain neurons, the operational state of their neural networks is neither easy to follow nor predictable. Thus to solve some of the most pressing questions in the field of neuroscience, technological advances must be made so that the functioning of brains can be studied under more naturalistic conditions. To this end, a team of scientists in engineering, nanoscience, chemistry, computer science, and biology will work together to design, fabricate and test a novel brain recording and stimulation device that, in parallel, will detect fluctuations in neuroactive substances. The team will begin by making prototypes of the device and testing it on leech and insect brains that have fewer neurons, but have well defined correlations between nerve cell activity and behaviors. The team is committed to the interdisciplinary cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students, especially females and underrepresented minorities. The goal of team mentoring is such that students will be well versed in both the biological and engineering aspects of the device. School visits are also planned to engage K-12 students in neuroscience, chemistry and engineering-related demonstrations, encouraging them to participate in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The cross-disciplinary team will fabricate and test a novel multi-electrode integrated ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) device and chemical sensing system having high temporal resolution. Patterned brain activity will be collected in parallel with neuromodulatory substances such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and octopamine (OA). The team's aim is to fabricate a device that will be 2 x 2 mm square, micron-level thin, flexible and biocompatible for extended use, with a minimum of output wires; our future goal will be to develop a completely remote sensing/monitoring capability. Such post-fabrication modification will be conducted at the University of Minnesota's Nano Center. Furthermore, the team aims to identify conserved neural algorithms or rules for context-dependent decision making that span the invertebrates (leech and honey bee) to non-human primates. Fabricated devices will be placed: 1) around dorsal and ventral aspects of the brain of the leech while it makes a decision to crawl or swim (DA and 5-HT-dependent switching); 2) over the Kenyon cells of the honey bee brain during a modified PER (proboscis-extension) learning-and-memory task (potential DA, 5-HT, and OA involvement); and 3) over the Prefrontal Cortex of monkeys during a spatial-cognitive task that will mimic one used for the honey bee (measuring DA changes).",Neuroscience,

Such names consist of two words in Latin - genus name and specific epithet - for example, Homo sapiens for humans. For higher classifications Linneaus adopted names consisting of a single Latin word. This nomenclatural system dramatically simplified handling species information, and gave scientists from different countries a standard way of communication. This system has been so successful it has persisted for over 250 years and is still in very active use today. An enormous amount of scientific and popular science literature uses scientific names. In the electronic age scientific names enable the effective organization of biodiversity information from various sources, as demonstrated by the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org) and Biodiversity Heritage Library (http://bhl.org). However the naming system introduced by Linnaeus is far from perfect. For example, if scholars decide to move a particular species to different genus - the name changes, and finding information about it becomes much more difficult. For example, a very prominent model organism of modern science Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is now recommended to be placed in the genus Sophophora, changing its name to Sophophora melanogaster. Such changes are inevitable in Linnaean nomenclature, and they create a significant amount of confusion. The project aims to create a system which would allow a user to enter a name, and find out if it is a known scientific name, if another name should be used instead, if there are other historical synonyms, and if this name is a misspelling of a known scientific name. The system will also display which data sources contain information related to a name, and will provide a list of relevant web-pages (URLs). This project aims to make significant strides in removing ambiguity and confusion from biodiversity data. Teaching activities are planned with college students at Arizona State and there are opportunities for participation in Google Summer of Code and Biodiversity informatics training courses developed at MBL.<br/><br/>The first stage of the research was also funded by NSF and it allowed the development of a prototype and 'proof of concept' algorithms for finding and verifying scientific names in texts, images, species lists. This second phase aims to make production version of the algorithms, make them precise, fast, and scale them up to serve the global biological community.  The task of scientific name disambiguation is not a simple one. It requires cooperation of many researchers. Discovery of scientific names in texts uses natural language processing algorithms which we plan to improve. The project aims to collect all known spellings and renderings of scientific names (20 million are currently collected) and organizes them into groups belonging to the same sets of organisms. It also catalogues where each spelling was used and stores information as a global name index. The database is powered by a search engine which uses fuzzy matching algorithms, and name parsing algorithms to find that names like 'Carek scirpoidea Michx. var. convoluta Kük.' and 'Carex scirpoidea subsp. convoluta (Kukenth) D.

Complex phenotypes characterized by a variety of features are often associated with substantial phenotypic variation. Current statistical methods are ineffective to address this phenotypic heterogeneity, and hence lack of power to associate genetic variants with the phenotype. This project aims to design new algorithms that differentiate homogenous subtypes of a complex phenotype that are most informative in genetic analysis, and identify genetic variants that are associated with the subtypes but cannot be detected by the non-differentiated phenotype. The validity of the subtypes will be proved in multiple scales including the evidence from genomic structure and phenotypic features. The new algorithms will be validated in the areas of genetic selection for complex traits of agriculturally-important animals and plants. This project serves a vehicle to train graduate students in the multidisciplinary methods involving computer science and biology, and allow them to apply the methods in a variety of biological fields. A new course in the bioinformatics field will be developed for senior undergraduate students. High school educational materials will also be developed to educate high school students about how to mathematically model biological data so it solves biological problems.<br/><br/>This project will derive novel analytics based on quantitative genetics theory and machine learning theory to refine complex phenotypes for enhanced discovery of genotype-phenotype correlations. Using empirical and statistically rigorous methods, this project will derive composite traits, as functions of multiple phenotypic features, that are optimized with respect to narrow-sense heritability, and that map readily to specific genomic regions. Two statistical models for estimating narrow-sense heritability will be considered: one based on sample pedigrees, and the other directly uses the whole-genome markers. To identify multi-scale evidence of a subtype that is characterized by a composite trait, a new machine learning framework will be derived to jointly analyze genotypes and phenotypes. By testing the algorithms in the analysis of large-scale biological databases, the new algorithms will derive highly heritable composite traits for feed efficiency of dairy cattle and adaptive traits of soybean to improve their genetic selection. The algorithms developed in this project will also advance the machine learning field by defining and addressing new research problems, such as the joint model inference using data from multiple sources, probabilistic clustering based on matrix decomposition, and quadratic optimization for heritability estimation. This project will yield user-friendly software tools that can be broadly deployed to biological research areas that study genetics of complex phenotypes.

In addition, the data-intensive computational methods commonly needed to analyze big datasets are not easily accessible to most researchers. This high-risk, high-reward project could dramatically alter both the ways in which ecologists address questions and the types of questions that they tackle. It therefore represents a major contribution to NSF's efforts to extend ecological research in new directions to provide answers to more complex questions. <br/><br/>A knowledge-driven, open access system that 'learns' and becomes more efficient and easier to use as data streams increase in variety and size is needed for timely scientific progress in an era of big data. This approach is centered on establishing linkages between databases and hypothesis-based inquiry that result in the derivation of new or refined hypotheses as a result of improved access to dynamic databases. The investigators recently implemented a hypothesis-driven, process-based analytical methodology that was conceptually integrated with a data-intensive machine learning approach. This integrated approach allowed them to use multiple long-term datasets to narrow a diverse suite of mechanistic explanations to a single, most likely process. This process was then tested by a short-term experiment that saved time and money and yielded a more definitive answer than the more traditional approach described above. To further this approach, this project will test, refine, and automate this new integrative effort to develop a prototype cyber-infrastructure capable of significantly advancing the environmental sciences. Open access data, programming scripts, and derived data products will reduce the time lag for knowledge transfer from an individual to the research community, likely increase the speed of scientific progress, and provide a filter and memory for how to deal with large amounts of data of mixed quality. A postdoctoral researcher will work collaboratively with computer scientists, ecologists, and eco-informatics experts from three universities (New Mexico State University, University of Texas El Paso, and Evergreen College) and one corporation (Microsoft) to develop, test, and automate this knowledge-learning analytics system.

Biological network inference has become a key analysis tool in modern biology allowing scientists to gain a  better understanding of basic biology such as evolution, molecular biology and genetics. Network inference algorithms have played significant roles in understanding gene networks from molecular data but are limited by the large search space of the network structure and data insufficient for statistical power. The goal of this project is to develop a computational framework, based on statistical and machine learning techniques, for effectively integrating multiple heterogeneous data sets to infer gene networks accurately. The developed methods will be applied to answer important biological questions, such as: How is a gene network reshaped in the evolutionary process of yeast species?, How do genes and proteins interact with one another underlying a certain biological trait?, and Which genes contain causative sequence variations that influence important biological traits?. This project is expected to dramatically increase the applicability of network learning algorithms in a wide variety of applications, especially those with smaller sample sizes. The implementation of the developed methods will be made publicly available, which can help many other biologists to study gene networks in their research problems. This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has significant emphasis on interdisciplinary education, through project courses and outreach activities. It will have a long-term effect of advancing the field of biology, by increasing the number of students in computer science inspired to solve biology problems.<br/><br/>Network inference from high-throughput biological data has significantly contributed to advancing our knowledge of molecular biology, evolution and genetics. Its major drawback is that, due to the exponentially large search space of the network structure, the sample size provided by a single dataset is often not large enough to obtain valid inference results. However, simply appending datasets from different studies is unlikely to be successful, because in many cases they contain different variables and overly heterogeneous samples. The goal of this project is to develop an innovative probabilistic approach to integrate multiple heterogeneous datasets, by jointly modeling one or more networks represented by these datasets. This project addresses the problem of how to integrate datasets containing heterogeneous samples (Aim 1), different sets of variables (Aim 2) and fundamentally different types of measurements (Aim 3). The developed algorithms in each Aim is applied to the following problems: 1) learning a network model that can represents evolutionary rewiring of gene regulatory networks across Saccharomyces species; 2) learning a joint latent network model that can infer a very high-dimensional network underlying biofilm phenotypes in S. cerevisiae by combining datasets with different variables; and 3) identifying hubs in the gene network from many expression datasets, to guide quantitative trait loci studies in S. cerevisiae.",Molecular biology ,joint latent gene network model

The first goal will be to identify which environmental variables most strongly affect plant demographic rates such as survival, growth, and fecundity. This work will draw upon long-term studies on natural communities that provide observations on thousands of individual plants over multiple decades, along with numerous environmental variables that are measured at high spatial and temporal resolution.

How organisms buffer themselves against this variability, and exploit it, are major challenges for ecology. This project will combine new statistical and mathematical theory with long-term data sets on semi-arid plant communities to address two challenges in understanding how variable environments affect populations. The first goal will be to identify which environmental variables most strongly affect plant demographic rates such as survival, growth, and fecundity. This work will draw upon long-term studies on natural communities that provide observations on thousands of individual plants over multiple decades, along with numerous environmental variables that are measured at high spatial and temporal resolution. With so many potential explanatory variables, standard statistical methods for variable selection are unstable and unreliable. This project will combine data mining methods from machine learning techniques with traditional statistical theory to identify important environmental drivers, and build more reliable demographic models. Ecological questions that will be addressed include whether demographic rates respond primarily to resource availability (e.g., soil moisture) versus non-resource variables such as temperature; how environment and competition interact; and how strongly past conditions affect current performance. The empirical data sets will be used to answer these questions and look for generalities across multiple communities.

As evolution is the ultimate tinkerer of living systems systematic comparisons of how regulatory networks evolve to drive species-specific differences are critical to understand cellular functions. Through advances in genomics, it is now possible to measure the activity levels of almost all genes for many species. This provides a unique opportunity to systematically compare these gene activity levels across multiple organisms and link changes in activity to changes in the networks of individual species. However, this is challenging because, first, such comparisons require the regulatory networks to be known in not one but multiple species including those that are poorly characterized, and second, computational methods to compare molecular datasets across species other than DNA sequence are in their infancy. This project will address these challenges by developing novel computational methods to identify and compare regulatory networks across multiple species. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to establish a comparative network biology framework to study evolutionary dynamics of regulatory networks. In Aim 1, algorithms for regulatory network reconstruction that combine probabilistic models of evolution with network reconstruction will be developed, that take into account both sequence and expression determinants of regulatory networks. The network reconstruction algorithms will incorporate structural constraints of regulatory networks such as modular organization, where sets of genes are coordinately regulated to achieve specific cellular functions. In Aim 2, methods to identify and correlate regulatory network patterns of divergence to phenotypic states will be developed. In Aim 3, methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be applied to published and newly generated expression datasets in yeast and land plant phylogenies to study the evolution of stress response, carbon metabolism and plant-microbe relationships. Network predictions will be interpreted and tested by yeast and plant collaborators in the laboratory. This research project intersects several computational (graph theory, algorithms, machine learning) and biological (gene regulation and evolution) areas of research, providing an excellent training opportunity for scientists at the interface of these areas. The planned outreach activities include developing a Network biology course, and network biology boot camp for a broader audience including high school teachers. The PI will organize summer research internships in Network biology for undergraduate students from underrepresented and minority groups through the Computational Biology and Biostatistics Summer Research Opportunities (CBB SROP) at UW Madison, and participate in general public outreach from the Town Center at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (a public venue for regular school field trips and Science festivals). Software tools and resources developed by this proposal will be made publicly available through dedicated websites.",Molecular biology ,"Graph theory, ML"

Drosophila larvae, with 10000 neurons (and about 1000 neuron types), offer an opportunity to determine how an entire nervous system generates behavior.  The research combines information from three sources: a neuron activity map of the entire Drosphila larval  nervous system; a library of neuronal lines yielding a neuron behavior map; and a ""wiring diagram"" or connectome for the entire larval nervous system. Together, the neuron-behavior map, the neuron-activity map, and the connectome complement one another, laying the groundwork for a brain-wide understanding of the principles by which brains generate behavior.<br/><br/>The technical goals for this project will be to develop principled statistical pattern recognition & machine learning methods for clustering neurons based on three different data sets, both individually and jointly. The extent to which clusters obtained from the three datasets agree, and the manner in which they disagree, will reveal how the structure of neural circuits relates to their function and how brains generate behavior. Current methods for discovery and characterization of neural circuitry from behavior, connectivity patterns and activity patterns - fusion and inference from multiple disparate data sources- are insufficient; the approach developed in this project will yield improved methods developed in conjunction with neuroscientists.",Neuroscience,"Pattern recognition, ML"
